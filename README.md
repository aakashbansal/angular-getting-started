# angular-getting-started
The given repository contains project code for the Pluralsight course Angular: Getting Started by Deborah Kurata.

## Project Setup

The following project requires **Node.Js** and **NPM** to be pre-installed and the necessary path variables for **Node** and **NPM** should also be set-up already.

Open the terminal/command-line :

```
$ cd \<required-directory>
$ git clone https://github.com/aakashbansal/angular-getting-started.git
$ cd \angular-getting-started
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This starts the local server. Now open the web browser and go to **http://localhost:3000/** to view the app.
